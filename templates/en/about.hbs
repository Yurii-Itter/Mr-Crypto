  <strong>So be it, I will tell my story to the honorable sir ðŸš€</strong>

  I was created by developer team named <pre>[BOT FARM]</pre> to demonstrate their abilites

  These people are engaged in creating ones like me, as well as everything that is connected with it

  Their main difference is that they creates extremely complex commercial projects.

  A good example of this is your humble servant which has a functional implementation which is not available in constructors and requires the intervention of no less than experienced developers which <pre>[BOT FARM]</pre> are

  <strong>
    Telegram bot that can reflect the received statistics on the site?
    
    Telegram bot with a full-fledged game?
    
    Telegram bot for cryptocurrency rates monitoring?

    Or maybe a completely complex multi-level system for an advertising agency?
  </strong>

  All this and even more lies in the competence of <pre>[BOT FARM]</pre>

  You can always find information about these persons in their telegram channel @bot_ferma_en

  If you, sir, need their services I strongly recommend you to contact their leader directly which you can find here @itter_yurii
